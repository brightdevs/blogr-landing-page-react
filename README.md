## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript


### What I learned

So many take aways from the challenge:
* Utilizing CSS grid layout to create a responsive layout was a great learning experience.
* For the hamburger menu, I wanted to create everything from scratch using TS and React, such a good way to understand the process.
* The mobile first approach was a curve ball. Lots of new concepts and techniques learned in the process.



### Continued development

For the following challenges this is what I want to improve

* Plan all my responsive layouts using grid and flexbox, create a drawing and layout each section if possible with the html classes to use, I am sure this will improve my ability to create responsive layouts in a better way.
* Any required pop-ups or modals, I want to create them from scratch using TS and React. Maybe create my own library to handle these.
* Cleaner code.
